# SkylineAnimation
This program was created by me and two group members for an animation class taken at UT Austin.

To run the program put all files into Processing including all of the object classes and the main SkylineAnimation class and click Run!

The intended animation is a scene going from day to night. The scene includes
a collection of buildings and houses, a sun that goes across the screen and a
bird that flies across the screen while flapping its wings during the day. The
scene includes the same buildings and houses, a moon that goes across the screen,
a bat that flies across the screen while flapping its wings and stars that
twinkle from silver to gold during the night. 

For this program, I created the bird class, the bat and bluebird subclasses, and the star class. My group members were responsible for the other classes. All group members collectively contributed to the main class.
